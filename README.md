### Hi there üëã
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on 
  - CFD through Centrifugal Pump Simulation in Python and Simscale. [Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/CFD-cpump) 
  - Compling Economic based research papers and doing my own research on How development policies affect the generation of new start ups! This repository will also being to inclue simple economic calculation scripts in python. [Economics Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/Economic-Resources)
  - Application of Pythagorean Theorem in different Sports Analytics . [Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/pythagexp-sports)
  - Ramdomized evaluation repository that guides through building and designing randomized evaluations (contained in markdowns). [Repo Here](https://github.com/mcrd25/randomized-evaluations)
    Will also contain sample code in Python and diagrams for Data Anylsis process:
    - Data Security processes
    - Data Cleaning
    - Exploritory Analysis
    - Core Analysis
    - Data Visualization
    - Cost Effective Analysis (CAE)

  - Domestic/GBV (disproportionate violence against women and children)  Violence in Trinidad newspaper article identifier and data scraper for TT based NGO üáπüáπ called the Andrea Project that uses SVC model (possible logistric regression classfication not 100% decided) for identification and extracts data (using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [Beautfiul Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from articles like weapon, genders involved, time, location etc. using word to vector approach as opposed to just naive symbolic approach that may result in combinational explosion. [(See research paper on word2vec here)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space). ***__Repo not currently publicly available - Should be eventually along with a possible white paper or emperical research paper on project. The project would be abstracted to be adapted by other countries, individuals, and organizations.__***
  - Covid 19 detection guide from chest x-rays using Convolutional Neural Networks. (Yes I know covid-19 is basically not a thing any more, which is exactly why this is a fun project). [See Repo Here](https://github.com/mcrd25/CNN-for-C19-chestxray-detection)
  -  Profit analysis using Economic Value added with financial as input. This project is based in python (makes use of tensorflow as well) and I will make Jupyter notebooks available. ***__No repo yet. Coming soon__***
  -  Replicated and abstracted analysis of how insurance coverage policies impact pharmaceutical innovation based on [This research](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210063&&from=f)
