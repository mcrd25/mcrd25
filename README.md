# Hi there 👋 
## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - DALL-E based AI vs human images guessor (WIP). Currently, repo only contains a simple script that uses the openai ada Completion model (can easily interchange among curie, davinci, babbage) to generate prompt to generate the images which can then be used to experiment and have fun generating images [See repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/python-image-gen). The current script can easily be used to create a continuous story with images with a few simple tweaks (which i may add to repo myself). However, the goal is to ultimately have a guessing game of whether an image is ai or human-based with two modes: 
     -  1) implement simple image classification model and used the model to have mode where AI guesses (drag and drop/upload image) and then allow user to confirm whether or not they know if it is AI-generated or human-generated.  Will then use this data to improve the image classification model.
     -  2)  allow humans to play a game and let them guess. This can give a neat statistic on quality of DALL-E images produced and how easy it is for humans to tell them apart.

    - Data Visualization
    - Cost Effective Analysis (CAE)
    - Data de-identification/anonymity process
    - Data Publication
  - Covid 19 detection guide from chest x-rays using Convolutional Neural Networks. (Yes I know covid-19 is basically not a thing anymore, which is exactly why this is a fun project). [See Repo Here](https://github.com/mcrd25/CNN-for-C19-chestxray-detection) 🧪 👩‍🔬
  -  Profit analysis using Economic Value Added (EVA) and TVM, that uses financial statements as input. This project is based in python (makes use of tensorflow as well) and I will make Jupyter notebooks available for finance professionals to easily navigate the analysis tutorial. **NOTE:** ***__No repo yet. Coming soon__***
 <!-- -  Replicated and abstracted analysis of how insurance coverage policies impact pharmaceutical innovation based on [This research](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210063&&from=f) 📜 **NOTE:** ***Initial stages of project, no repo yet*** -->
  -  Binary Search Tree implmentations and sample code in different languages. [See repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/bst) 🌲 2️⃣
<!--  -  Predicting Bitcoin Price Variations using Bayesian Regression = - **NOTE:** ***__no repo yet__*** 🪙
  -  Trying to updated current [Personal Projects Repo (compiled list of all decent projects on my github)](https://github.com/mcrd25/Personal-Projects)-->
  -  🧑‍💼 At work I work on Data Dashboards, Data|Economic Analysis & Prediction models( using Python, BI, Alteryx and SQL), Digital Transformation and automation (Process transformation in tax at @Deloitte KY Office and beyond), manage custom application development (to support digital transformation), and manage integration of new software for Tax (KY).
