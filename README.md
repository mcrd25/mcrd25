# Hi there 👋 
## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) through Centrifugal Pump Simulation in Python and Simscale. [Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/CFD-cpump) 👩‍🔬
 <!-- - Compiling list of publicly available Economic based research papers (but not private to associations such as AEA) and my own research, such as "How development policies affect the generation of new start ups". This repository will also include simple economic calculation/analysis scripts in python. [Economics Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/Economic-Resources)-->
  - Application of Pythagorean Expectation in different Sports Analytics . [Repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/pythagexp-sports)
  - Self-compiled/written Ramdomized evaluation repository that guides through building and designing randomized evaluations (contained in markdowns). [Repo Here](https://github.com/mcrd25/randomized-evaluations) 
    Ramdomized evaluations repository Will also contain personal sample code in Python and diagrams for Data Anaylsis process in preparing and executing Randomized Evaluations. This includes code and diagrams on: 
    - Data Security processes
    - Data Cleaning
    - Exploratory Analysis
    - Core Analysis
    - Data Visualization
    - Cost Effective Analysis (CAE)
    - Data de-identification/anonymity process
    - Data Publication
 - Covid 19 detection guide from chest x-rays using Convolutional Neural Networks. (Yes I know covid-19 is basically not a thing anymore, which is exactly why this is a fun project). [See Repo Here](https://github.com/mcrd25/CNN-for-C19-chestxray-detection) 🧪 👩‍🔬
 <!-- -  Profit analysis using Economic Value Added (EVA) and TVM, that uses financial statements as input. This project is based in python (makes use of tensorflow as well) and I will make Jupyter notebooks available for finance professionals to easily navigate the analysis tutorial. **NOTE:** ***__No repo yet. Coming soon__***
  -  Replicated and abstracted analysis of how insurance coverage policies impact pharmaceutical innovation based on [This research](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210063&&from=f) 📜 **NOTE:** ***Initial stages of project, no repo yet*** -->
  -  Binary Search Tree implmentations and sample code in different languages. [See repo here](https://github.com/mcrd25/bst) 🌲 2️⃣
<!--  -  Predicting Bitcoin Price Variations using Bayesian Regression = - **NOTE:** ***__no repo yet__*** 🪙
  -  Trying to updated current [Personal Projects Repo (compiled list of all decent projects on my github)](https://github.com/mcrd25/Personal-Projects)-->
  -  🧑‍💼 At work I work on Data Dashboards, Data|Economic Analysis & Prediction models( using Python, BI, Alteryx and SQL), Digital Transformation and automation (Process transformation in tax at @Deloitte KY Office and beyond), manage custom application development (to support digital transformation), and manage integration of new software for Tax (KY).
 



## 💬 Ask me about:
  - Digital Transformation (Tax|Finance, Energy, General)
  - API Development
  - JavaScript
  - Full-Stack Development and Management
  - Automation
  - System Design
  - Randomized Evaluations
  - Starting startups - developing MVP to get out into market (I work and consult with start ups mostly)
  - Exploratory Analysis
  - Economics (depends on area, particularly Microeconomics)
  - Binary Search Tree and Graph theory
